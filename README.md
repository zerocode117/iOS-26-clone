A refined, high-fidelity replica of core iOS system apps, built end‑to‑end in pure SwiftUI. All interfaces and components were AI‑generated (Google Gemini 3.0 Pro) then polished manually for pixel‑level accuracy and clean architecture.

This sandbox showcases how modern SwiftUI + AI can rapidly prototype authentic iOS experiences—layouts, gestures, transitions, theming—while remaining readable and extensible.

## Features

The following system applications have been recreated:

*   **Weather**
*   **Calendar**
*   **Photos**
*   **Clock**
*   **Notes**
*   **Calculator**
*   **Settings**
*   **Mail**
*   **App Store**
*   **Phone**
*   **Safari**
*   **Camera**
*   **Music**
